# Sunrise Lamp

DIY sunrise lamp using a Raspberry Pi, Some LEDS and a Flask web application

Raspberry pi is set up as an Nginx server, following [this digital ocean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uswgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04)

The flask app allows the settings of the alarm to be changed on a local network, as well as controlling the lamp remotely.
